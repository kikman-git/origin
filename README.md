## The Problem

Fundamental equity research is broken for Japan-focused institutional investors.

| Pain Point | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Language Barrier** | 70%+ of Japanese corporate filings, earnings transcripts, and IR materials are only available in Japanese — inaccessible to most global fund managers |
| **Manual & Slow** | Analysts spend 15–20 hours per company on fundamental research; coverage is limited to 20–40 names per analyst, leaving thousands of opportunities unseen |
| **Fragmented Data** | Critical data is scattered across EDINET, TDNet, company IR sites, and local news — no single platform synthesizes it for actionable insights |

> 3,900+ listed companies in Japan · Only ~15% covered by English-language research · $6.2T market cap

---

## Our Solution

*Think of it as a team of 100 AI analysts working 24/7.*

Each specialized agent handles one piece of the research puzzle — reading Japanese filings, building financial models, running valuations, synthesizing news — then orchestrates them into institutional-grade research reports.

- **Japanese NLP** that understands financial context and nuance
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: each agent = one research task
- **Automated financial modeling**, valuation, and risk scoring
- Designed for Japan first, **architected for global scale**

## Competitive Moat: Origin vs. General LLM Research

While general tools like **ChatGPT Deep Research** provide broad synthesis, Origin (NousAlpha) is built specifically for the high-stakes environment of institutional fundamental research.

| Feature | ChatGPT Deep Research | **Origin (NousAlpha)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Access** | Public web-crawled data | **Proprietary & Alternative Data**: Real-time satellite imagery (geospatial AI), direct EDINET/TDNet pipelines, and private IR transcripts. |
| **Orchestration** | Single-model sequential search | **Specialized Swarm**: Fine-tuned orchestrator managing vertical experts (Macro, Quant, Disclosure, Geospatial) trained on institutional research styles. |
| **Analysis Depth** | Summary of found text | **Fundamental Stress-Testing**: Built-in adversarial "Bull vs. Bear" loops that perform YoY forensic accounting and "diff" analysis on risk factors. |
| **Verification** | Citations to URLs | **Decision Traces**: Multi-modal evidence chains linking every claim back to exact J-GAAP footnotes or audio timestamps. |

## Agent Pipeline

```
Data Ingestion → Japanese NLP → Financial Modeling → Valuation Engine → Report Generation
(EDINET, TDNet,   (Filings,        (3-statement         (DCF, comps,       (Institutional-grade
 IR sites, news)   transcripts,     models, scenario     sum-of-parts)       research output)
                   mgmt commentary) analysis)
```

**Platform capabilities:** Real-time monitoring · Multi-company screening · Custom agent workflows · API integration

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Backend | FastAPI, Python 3.12 |
| Agent Orchestration | LangGraph (sequential chaining & agent handoffs) |
| Adversarial Framework | AutoGen / AG2 (Bull vs. Bear debate loop) |
| Real-time Monitoring | Redis (100+ concurrent data streams) |

## Architecture

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full swarm topology diagram.

Key components:
1. **Swarm Topology** — Specialized vertical agents (IR, Company, News, Satellite) each own their research domain
2. **Central Senior Analyst** — Synthesizes sub-agent reports into an institutional-grade investment memo
3. **Adversarial Debate Loop** — Bull Agent forms thesis → Bear Agent stress-tests with forensic accounting analysis
4. **Decision Traces** — Every claim in the final report is clickable, linking back to the exact source (filing, transcript, audio)
5. **Omni-Channel Ingestion** — Normalizes J-GAAP, IFRS, and US-GAAP data; monitors real-time macro feeds

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### MCP Server (optional)

```bash
cd mcp
pip install -e .
